            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build symmetric patterns of atoms by placing the center atoms on the outer ring. 
            Place Plus Atoms on lines of symmetry to accumulate score and reduce your atom count.
            Leverage Minus Atoms to rearrange your atoms before you run out of space!

              What's so deep about Deep Atomas?
            </h3>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep Atomas is equipped with an AI agent that uses Deep Q-Learning to study millions of games of Atomas.
            Tapping the brain icon will let Deep Atomas take a turn for you, but bewareâ€” 
            Deep Atomas is currently quite shallow. It averages about 75 points per game.
